## Phase 1: Brand Alignment & Copy Hygiene ✅

### 1.1 Experience Years Correction

**Issue**: Multiple instances referenced "15+ years" experience, contradicting actual "1+ years"

**Files Updated**:

1. **`lib/data/aboutPage.ts`**
   - Line 8: Changed "fifteen years of work experience" → "1+ year of focused work experience"
   - Line 13: Changed "Over the 15 years" → "Over the past year"

2. **`components/sections/AboutDetail.tsx`**
   - Line 50: Changed "15+ Experience" → "1+ Experience"

3. **`lib/data/projectsReal.ts`**
   - Line 458: Verified - "15+" refers to features analyzed, not years (correct context)

**Status**: ✅ Complete

### 1.2 Pricing & Package Language

**Added Budget-Friendly Messaging**:

1. **`lib/data/faq.ts`** - Enhanced with 3 new pricing FAQs:
   - "How Much Do Your Services Cost?" - Updated to highlight $500-$1,000 starter packages
   - "Do You Offer Payment Plans?" - New FAQ about payment flexibility
   - "Can We Start With A Smaller Package?" - New FAQ encouraging starter projects

2. **`components/sections/FAQ.tsx`**

**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## Phase 2: Conversion Funnel Optimization ✅

- Hidden on `/contact` page
- Pulse animation every 3s (respects reduced-motion)
- Z-index: 50 (doesn't overlap mobile menu)
- Touch-optimized for mobile

**Integration**: Added to `app/layout.tsx` for global availability

**Status**: ✅ Complete

### 2.2 Service Page CTAs Enhancement

**Updated**: `components/sections/Services.tsx`

**Improvements**:
- Primary CTA: "Get Started" button (prominent gradient style)
- Secondary action: "Learn More" button (outline style)
- Added pricing hint: "From $500" below CTAs
- Dual-button layout (responsive: stacks on mobile, side-by-side on desktop)

**Status**: ✅ Complete

### 2.3 Contact Form Simplification

**Updated**: `components/sections/ContactForm.tsx`

**Optimization**:

---

## Phase 3: Visual Consistency & Polish

### 3.1 Animation Standardization

**Updated**: `lib/utils/animation.ts`

**Added standardized hover effects**:
```typescript
hoverButton: scale: 1.05, duration: 200ms, ease-out
hoverCard: translateY: -8px, duration: 300ms, ease-out
hoverImage: scale: 1.05, duration: 500ms, ease-out
```

**Status**: ✅ Complete

### 3.2 Spacing & Typography

**Already Completed**: Recent responsive audit ensured consistency across:
- Section padding: `py-16 md:py-24 lg:py-32`
- Card padding: `p-6 md:p-8`
- Gap spacing: `gap-6 md:gap-8 lg:gap-12`
- Max-width containers: `max-w-7xl mx-auto`

**Status**: ✅ Already optimized

---

## Phase 5: Live Tenure Calculation ✅

### 5.1 Utility Function Created

**File**: `lib/utils/tenure.ts` (NEW)

**Features**:
- `calculateTenure()`: Returns display string, months count, isPresent flag
- `formatTenureDisplay()`: Shorthand for display string only
- Handles edge cases:
  - Same month start/end
  - Year crossovers
  - Leap year February
  - Proper pluralization (1 month vs 2 months)
  - Years + months formatting (e.g., "1 year 3 months")

**Example Output**:
```typescript
calculateTenure('March 2025', 'Present')
// Returns: { 
//   display: "Mar 2025 – Present · 8 months", 
//   months: 8, 
//   isPresent: true 
// }
```

**Status**: ✅ Complete

### 5.2 Experience Data Integration

**Updated**: `lib/data/experience.ts`

**Added**:
- Import of `calculateTenure` utility
- New export: `experienceWithTenure` - Auto-calculates tenure for current roles
- Updates duration dynamically for roles with `endDate: 'Present'`

**Status**: ✅ Complete

### 5.3 UI Component Integration

**Updated**: `components/sections/ExperienceSection.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Switched from `experienceData` to `experienceWithTenure`
- Now displays live-calculated tenure for current positions
- Duration updates automatically based on current month

**Status**: ✅ Complete

- ✅ All images already using Next.js `<Image>` component
- ✅ Hero portrait has `priority` loading
- ✅ `sizes` prop properly configured for responsive images
- ✅ `fill` used appropriately for flexible containers
- ✅ Lazy loading implicit for below-the-fold images

**Status**: ✅ Already optimized

### 6.2 Animation Performance

**Findings**:
- ✅ All animations use GPU-accelerated properties (`transform`, `opacity`)
- ✅ `prefers-reduced-motion` support implemented throughout
- ✅ No layout-shifting animations (`height`, `width`, `top`, `left` avoided)
- ✅ `will-change` used sparingly

**Status**: ✅ Already optimized

---

## Phase 7: Accessibility Improvements ✅

### 7.1 Focus Management

**Updated**: `components/layout/Header.tsx`

**Enhancements**:
- Added visible focus rings to all navigation links
  - `focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-primary-500 focus:ring-offset-2`

**Status**: ✅ Complete

### 7.2 ARIA Labels & Semantic HTML
